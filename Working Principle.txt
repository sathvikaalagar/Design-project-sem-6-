WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE PROJECT:

1. Voice Command Activation:
	The application listens for a specific voice command (e.g., "Hey buddy") to activate its functions.
2. Screenshot Capture:
	Upon recognizing the voice command, the application captures a screenshot of the current screen.
3. Feature Extraction:
	The captured screenshot is processed using the VGG16 model to extract image features.
4. Caption Generation:
	The extracted image features are fed into a pre-trained image captioning model.
	The model generates a descriptive caption for the screenshot.
5. Text-to-Speech Conversion:
	The generated caption is converted to speech using a text-to-speech engine, providing audio feedback to the user.
6. Saving Captions:
	The generated caption is also saved to a text file for reference.
7. Continuous Listening:
	The application resumes listening for voice commands, ready to repeat the process.

These points summarize the core functionalities and workflow of the project.
