HOW TO RUN THE CODE :

1. Setup Environment:
	Install necessary libraries (Flask, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pyautogui, TensorFlow, etc.).
2. Prepare Data:
	Download and organize image and caption data.
	Extract image features using VGG16 and save to a file.
3. Load Data:
	Load image features and captions into the program.
	Clean Captions:
4. Preprocess captions (lowercase, remove non-alphabetic characters, add start/end tokens).
5. Create Vocabulary:
	Tokenize captions and create word-index mappings.
6. Train Image Captioning Model:
	Define and train the model using image features and caption sequences.
7. Save Model:
	Save the trained model's architecture and weights.
8. Initialize Flask App:
	Create and configure the Flask application.
9. Define Functions:
	speak: Converts text to speech.
	listen_for_voice_command: Listens for voice commands.
	take_screenshot_and_generate_caption: Captures a screenshot, generates a caption, and speaks it.
11. Start Flask App:
	Start the Flask application and the voice command listener in a separate thread.
12. Activate Listening:
	Use the /activate route to start listening for voice commands.

This overview outlines the main steps to prepare, run, and interact with the program.
